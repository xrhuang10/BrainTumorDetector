    <h1>🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using Neural Networks</h1>
    <p>A machine learning project that uses a neural network to detect and classify brain tumors into one of four categories: <b>Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, or Pituitary</b>.</p>
    
<h2>📂 Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset consists of <b>1300 MRI images</b> sourced from Kaggle. It has been preprocessed to improve model performance.</p>
<p>I preprocessed the dataset by applying computer vision and 2D image manipulation concepts, such as convoluting, scaling, rotating.</p>

<h2>🧑‍💻 Model Architecture</h2>
<p>The model consists of a <b>3-layer neural network</b> trained for 50 epochs, achieving an accuracy of <b>96%</b>.</p>
<p>I created a visual display of epoch accuracy over time.</p>
<p>I also used Flask to create a front-end, where users can input their own brain tumor MRI images.</p>

<h2>🛠️ Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Python</b> - Core programming language</li>
    <li><b>Pandas</b> - Data handling and preprocessing</li>
    <li><b>TensorFlow & Keras</b> - Neural network implementation</li>
    <li><b>Flask</b> - Used for the front-end to create an interactive UI</li>
</ul>
